    <p>There was absolutely nothing he’d hoped for—his special attack, his skill strategy and every move forward or backward.</p>
    <p>All they had was a rush of surging waves, impatiently monotonous attacks and defense that gradually formed traps.</p>
  </text>
  <text>...This wasn't the sparring match Li Sushang had envisioned.</text>

    <p>"Eagle"’s right fist was completely powerless, clearly a diversion.[\s]</p>
    <p>However, the diversion wasn’t meant to lure in enemies or defend against them—it was actually a half-assed move that only gave her enough time for preparations</p>

    <p>Sushang has been waiting for that brief moment.</p>
    <p>With Type 1 「Kaken: Kumotaka」, she switched from defense to offense</p>
    <p>In an instant, I pull out 「Open Sword: Instant Dust」 and stab it into"Eagle"'s throat.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>The sword of the Void Sword extends with its physical form.[\s]</p>
    <p>When you have a sword in your hand, this technique becomes merciless kenjutsu that aims straight for the enemy’s throat by imbuing them with true energy</p>

    <p>With the godlike speed of Li Sushang, there was no other way for her opponent to do anything but force this sword.</p>
    <p>She used her fingers instead of a sword, preparing for "Eagle"’s return move.</p>

    <p>Just in the nick of time, Li Sushang suddenly realized something.</p>
    <p>To tell the truth, she hadn't been prepared for this until now.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>She didn’t have the resolve to wield a sword, fight her way out of this mess or kill anyone...</p>
    <p>She was nothing more than a fifteen-year old girl who thought she’d stepped into the martial arts world, but in reality hadn't abandoned her feelings of respect for people and their lives.</p>

  <dialog chara="002">「--!」</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>In front of the evildoer who is about to die at his own hands...</p>

    <p>Li Sushang gritted her teeth and decided to pull back the technique—</p>

    <p>To disperse the power of her technique, she lightly tapped on his toes</p>
    <p>All I could do was cast 「Hien homing」 and use the rotation to whittle down its power.</p>
