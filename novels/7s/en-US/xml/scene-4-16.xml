    <p></p>
    <p>Each faction in Shinshu has their own unique way of thinking. However, even though the formalities have changed and its essence remains unchanged—it all comes down to training</p>

    <p>If one were to compare Majic with water, a normal Uchiko would be like training the vessel for putting it in and increasing its capacity.[\s]</p>
    <p>Not only do I have to undergo harsh training, but my improvement is also extremely slow. And above all else there's a risk of putting too much strain on the human body</p>

    <p>On the other hand, 「Taixuan」 is fundamentally different from all others.[\s]</p>

    <p>「Blade Mantra」 trains not「Vessel」, 「Sandou」 but percentA.</p>
