  <text>Ma Feima turned around to see a girl leaning by the door, scowling at him:</text>

  <motion chara="008" action="img_trans" img="马非马-微笑-标准-远景"></motion>
  <text>Ma Feima couldn’t help but laugh. All these years, and his Fifth Senior Sister was still just as she was then. How was that not something to be happy about?</text>
  <dialog chara="007">[Looks like age hasn’t matured you one bit.]</dialog>

  <text>Lingshuang glanced inside the room and said coldly:</text>
  <dialog chara="007">
    <p>[You’ve always been a pretty good kid, and now you pick up fights whenever you want. </p>
    <p>Who gave you the right to hurt my disciple?]</p>

  <text>
    <p>Ma Feima stood there for a second. Even if he knew that his Fifth Senior Sister had taken in a disciple, he never actually associated the bonds of a master and a disciple with her. </p>
    <p>To him, she’d always been cold and emotionless.</p>

  <text>He raised his hand, and a gigantic object appeared.</text>
  <motion chara="007" action="img_trans" img="凌霜-注视-标准-远景"></motion>
  <text>It was a crimson greatsword about five feet in length. It looked kind of like Sushang’s Xuanyuan.</text>
  <text>The fifth disciple of Taixuan stared coldly at her sixth brother’s greatsword, a complicated look sparkling in her eyes.</text>
  <motion chara="007" action="img_trans" img="凌霜-哼-标准-远景"></motion>

  </dialog>
  <text>Ma Feima laughed heartily, but then adopted a more serious look, bowing down to the woman:</text>
  <motion chara="008" action="img_trans" img="马非马-沉思-握剑"></motion>

    <p>Ma Feima titled his head. This wasn’t the answer he was expecting. </p>
