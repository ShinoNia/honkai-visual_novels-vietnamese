    <p>The two best horses of the Golden Sand Gang pulled a cart along the desert. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Li Sushang leaned against the edge and began humming a tune in high spirits.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono chara="002" pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>[Raksha! You should stop your sorceries. It’s very refreshing to feel the wind blow across your face every once in a while.]</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>The fast moving cart drew up a strong wind, leaving Sushang’s braids flowing through the air like two dark rivers. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>On the other side, the Raksha shielded himself with an invisible air barrier. [\s]</p>
    <p>In the domain created by the relic [Void Archives], the man’s hair remained unmoved, as was his expression.</p>

    <p>[Are you mad? Oh sorry. It’s just… That carriage you conjured was a bit...] </p>

  <text>
    <p>While Sushang wasn’t so shocked by the tricks the Raksha pulled the day before, </p>
    <p>she couldn’t say the same now. </p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>The carriage was round and bumpy, and the bright orange color stuck out like a sore thumb. </p>
    <p>The Raksha had said that this was a western specialty called a [pumpkin] as he grinned at it.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Li Sushang was embarrassed. She’d rather walk than ride that kind of carriage.</text>

    <p>Sushang was truly concerned for the remnants of the Raksha’s Ki.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>However, the Raksha appeared to harbor a heavy grudge against the wind. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Even if he agreed to ride this scrappy carriage, he was determined to remain as elegant as possible, his hair undeterred from its place.</p>

    <p>[It’s a strange place indeed.]</p>

  <text>The Raksha stroked his chin, deep in thought.</text>
  <mono chara="001">[But that Eagle told me: [Everything here is mine, and you can give everything that is yours to me. Please, come out of the carriage and follow my servants. No need for formalities.] …Is that not an invitation?]</mono>

    <p>[That’s not my problem… Your language is too complicated.]</p>

  <text>Li Sushang stared at the man, raising an eyebrow. Was he playing her for a fool? </text>
