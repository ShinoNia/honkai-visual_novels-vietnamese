    <p>It turned into pain. Pain surged from my chest and stomach, shoulder blades or the crown of his head all at once—it was as if a flood had broken through an embankment</p>

    <p>What answered her was intense pain. All of it pounded in my head, and the sound mixed with that heartbeat so loud I couldn't sleep</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>...I felt safe, and I was so used to seeing her that it seemed the same as always.</p>

  <text>The girl tried to sit up, but she immediately cried out in pain.</text>
  <text>The wounds from his battle with Ma Feima weren't light. At this moment, just moving a little was enough to make him feel unbearable pain all over</text>

  <text>Having been told that, Sushang looked to her side and saw a Raksha sleeping next door.</text>
  <text>It was a little surprising, but this had been the first time I’d seen him close his eyes since we met.</text>

    <p>...Sadness welled up in her innocent heart, like sympathy.</p>

    <p>The blond-haired man who was fast asleep had the grace of a god, clear as day.</p>

  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>But right now, he seemed closer to flesh and blood than when she was awake.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>She didn’t try to gloss over it or hide, nor did she worry about the past and fixate on her future.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Raksha was simply sleeping. He slept, no different from any other normal person in the world...</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>Maybe... this is his true form?</p>

  <text>The girl instinctively pulled on the comforter and kicked a Raksha with her foot.</text>
  <text>The blond outlander fell off the bed and toppled over, but he still didn’t wake up.</text>

  <text>Her face turns bright red. Tears are welling up in her eyes, and she looks like they're about to fall out of them at any moment... But Lingshuang is completely unfazed by it all!</text>

  <text>Master lowered her eyes and silently thought.</text>
  <motion chara="002" action="img_trans" img="素裳-委屈-抱手-近景"></motion>
  <text>The girl sighed and suddenly realized something. It would be a little unreasonable to have her master understand this kind of common sense, wouldn't it?</text>
