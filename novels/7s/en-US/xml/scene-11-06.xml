    <p>Waves of information brushed against the man’s consciousness, again and again, again and again. [\s]</p>

    <p>Within the sea, limitless amounts of information floated and sank. </p>
    <p>What the man could grasp, were but mere planktons. </p>

    <p></p>
    <p>And among the information obtained by hand, there was very little usable; [\s]</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>But he was still searching.</p>

  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>The search will not stop. </p>
    <p>All this was to save that person——</p>
    <p>For this, does hard work mean anything? [\s]</p>
    <p>Does danger mean anything? [\s]</p>
