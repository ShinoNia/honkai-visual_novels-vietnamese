    <p>"Eagle" had already figured out the girl's temperament, </p>
    <p>and if she didn't ask for that "slap", the girl's target of attack would never turn elsewhere.</p>

  <text>
    <p>If the enemy's intention was known, </p>
    <p>the intention was no longer a life gate, but a life-saving talisman.</p>

  <text>
    <p>While attacking with full force, "Eagle" only needs to guard the top of the shoulder. </p>
    <p>At the same time, he was struggling with life and death, but his pressure was much lighter than Li Sushang.</p>
  </text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_老鹰战姿_拳血" duration="1"></cg>
  <text>
    <p>Of course, he didn't plan to fulfill any "gambling contract", </p>
    <p>Xuanyuan would stay, and Li Sushang's life would be forfeit. [\s]</p>
    <p>For this reason, what’s one more slap?</p>
  </text>
  <text>From the beginning, this was an unequal battle.</text>

    <p>"Eagle" did everything possible and exhausted his housekeeping skills. The purpose was not to injure the enemy, </p>
    <p>but to get close to the place where the ancient sword [Xuanyuan] was located.</p>

    <p>As soon as the two sides fought, "Eagle" knew that this girl was young but her skills were appallingly deep.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Not to mention strength and speed, but this was the skill of changing moves freely under Roaring Tiger, and it could be counted as a first-class player in the martial arts.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>For this alone, he was far from matching against her.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you continue to fight for a long time, you will undoubtedly lose.</p>
    <p> ——If you follow the rules.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>"Eagle" wasn’t a person who obeys the rules. [\s]</p>
    <p>What he wants is not to win, but to conquer.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This was the third advantage: "purpose." The same was "victory." </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The "victory" of "Eagle" was completely different from the "victory" of Li Sushang.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>What the girl pursued was the victory of the "match." </p>
    <p>What "Eagle" wants is the victory of the "war."</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p>"Victory of the war"... means getting what you want, destroying what you want to destroy. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Li Sushang obeyed the rules. </p>
    <p>But "Eagle" uses rules. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Use the opponent's "target" to protect oneself, </p>
    <p>use one’s own "flaws" to lure the enemy, </p>
    <p>and then use that sharp "sword" to kill.</p>

  <text>Sushang receded slowly, but from the lighter movements and expressions, he judged that the girl had become accustomed to her own boxing.</text>
  <text>The scale of victory and defeat won’t always lean towards one side, and the weight that symbolizes superiority changes all the time.</text>
  <text>The result of this battle must be determined within a few seconds.</text>
