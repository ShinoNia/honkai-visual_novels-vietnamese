  <text>
    <p>Therefore, when meeting the Raksha,</p>
    <p>the「Eagle」suddenly had the illusion of time recurring.</p>

  <text>
    <p>At first sight of this person, the「Eagle」's back went abruptly cold, </p>
    <p>The alarm bell sounded instinctively, telling him that this was a 「scourge」.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>At the time,「Scourge」stayed in the caravan's carriage and enjoyed a small cabin exclusively.</p>
    <p>Among the dozens of caravans, he is the only one who had this extraordinary treatment.</p>

  <text>When「Eagle」's sword brushed up the screen, Raksha was talking to something.</text>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Mach dir keine sorgen」(Don't worry)</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>The man knelt on one knee. His tone was calm and easy-going, as if he was asking a close travel companion, but he looked around:</p>
    <p>There was no one else in the compartment, only a coffin.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Only him, and a coffin.</text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场2"></cg>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Ich werde lösen」(I'll resolve.)</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>This person wasn't speaking in Raksha language,「Eagle」couldn't understand it.</p>
    <p>But this strange and terrifying scene had him sweating bullets.</p>
  </text>
  <text>He couldn't help but look up at the weird man who was talking to the coffin:</text>
  <transition mode="eye" in="1" stop="0.5" out="1" color="#000000"></transition>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场2" scale="3" origin="40%,80%"></cg>
  <delay t="0.1"></delay>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场2" scale="3" pos="0,500" origin="45%,80%" duration="30"></cg>
  <text>
    <p>The Raksha person was about twenty years old, tall and not strong looking.</p>
    <p>He obviously had some skills, but he was definitely not a master.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Just by observing his appearance and shape, you can know a little about how martial arts a person has.</text>
  <text>
    <p>If you have bulging muscles, you are a martial artist who practices Waijiaquan.</p>
    <p>This type of manpower sinks his shoulders and arms, strikes fists and feet that can break gold and gravel, and it was no problem to resist ordinary blunt weapons.</p>
  </text>
  <text>But the「Eagle」doesn't see this kind of person in their eyes.</text>
  <text>
    <p>The smart foreign kung fu emphasizes balance and permeates the whole body. Blindly insisting on fierce effort has lost flexibility.</p>
    <p>A person of both speed and strength, Fang is a middle-to-higher person.</p>
  </text>
  <text>The master of the inner family has another set of tricks.</text>
  <text>
    <p>Inner Kung fu exercises inner strength, that is, meridians and 「Zhen Qi」.</p>
    <p>This kind of person is introverted in appearance, and appears everywhere. Observe the expression in his eyes and listen to the expressions, and you can know the depth.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Needless to say, the「Eagle」glanced away, and it was known that this Raksha man's outside martial arts could be described as mediocre; from his chaotic breathing rhythm, he also knew that this man had never learned superior internal skills.</text>

  <dialog chara="015">Eagle:「Come out.」</dialog>
  <text>「Eagle」 said, his hand dropped on the handle of the scimitar.</text>
  <text>The Raksha hates him the most, and it is even more unlucky to hit the coffin in the daytime. The two taboos merge into one, and the 「Eagle」 has an impulse to sacrifice blood.</text>
  <text>
    <p>He was already full of blood debts, so why not add another life?</p>
    <p>But... the scimitar was not out of its sheath.</p>

  <transition mode="fade" in="1" stop="0.5" out="1" color="#000000"></transition>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场2"></cg>
  <text>The people of Raksha calmly asked in a lame but clear Chinese dialect:</text>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Arrive?」</dialog>
  <text>This question had no background and was too inexplicable, but the 「Eagle」 nodded.</text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场1"></cg>
  <text>The Raksha man pointedly:</text>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Here, yours?」</dialog>
  <dialog chara="015">「Eagle」:「This is mine, and you are mine. Come out .」</dialog>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场1"></cg>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Well……」</dialog>
  <text>The Raksha didn't say anything, but slowly stretched out, struggling to support his knees with his hands, as if to get up.</text>
  <text>
    <p>[em italic]The Raksha with a pose.[/em]</p>
    <p>「Eagle」couldn't help cursing in his heart. </p>
    <p>[em italic]When a hundred times people buy you away, it depends on how you look.[/em]</p>
  </text>
  <text>He suddenly missed the past. If ten years ago, he would have already taken the scimitar out and chopped off this beautiful head. </text>
  <text>
    <p>Dead Rakshas are worthless, but the living Rakshas are rare goods.</p>
    <p>A hundred slave traders prefer this bite, and they can always give a good price.</p>
  </text>
  <text>「Eagle」looked at the obedient Raksha, suddenly a little curious.</text>
  <text>
    <p>Why did he speak to the coffin?</p>
    <p>This person occupies a whole room alone, mysterious...</p>
    <p>Yes, he doesn't want people to know what was in the coffin.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Then…… what's in it?</text>
  <text>
    <p></p>
    <p>……What would it be? ?</p>

  <text>
    <p>「Eagle」has seen countless people in his life,</p>
    <p>And the eyes he has seen are countless.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Fear, hatred, anger, unwillingness, pain…… </p>
    <p>He has not only seen it, but was often the source of all these emotions.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>A blade on a neck is the best Verita serum in the world, </p>
    <p>it can completely expose a person's deepest heart.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>The「Eagle」was numb to his dying eyes, </p>
    <p>and was indifferent to his dying emotions.</p>
    <p>He had seen too many of those.</p>

    <p>「Eagle」gave a chuckle in his heart and swallowed and spit.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>This Raksha man didn't see him in his eyes at all.</p>
    <p>In the eyes of this person, the「Eagle」, leader of the Golden Sand Gang , was no different than a grain of sand in the desert.</p>
    <p>It had neither value nor meaning.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>He even had the illusion that in the next second, the Rakshas would walk over this grain of sand,</p>
    <p>And it would be as natural as a stroll.</p>

  <text>
    <p>Not afraid,「Eagle」told himself:</p>
    <p>He would never be afraid of a Raksha.</p>
  </text>
  <text>But the emotion in his heart made him more ashamed than fear, and made him want to run away from the person in front of him.</text>
